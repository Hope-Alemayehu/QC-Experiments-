# Feature Selection Experiment

This folder contains all files related to our **Feature Selection** experiment. The objective of this experiment is to compare classical feature selection methods with quantum versions implemented using **Dirac3** and **Qiskit**.

## Progress
- **Week 1**: Studied feature selection methods and identified classical algorithms for initial testing.
- **Week 2**: Started translating data into quantum circuit representations and ran initial tests using Dirac3.

## Next Steps
1. Complete classical vs quantum comparison using a simple dataset.
2. Analyze and document performance results in terms of:
   - Accuracy
   - F1 score
   - Processing time
