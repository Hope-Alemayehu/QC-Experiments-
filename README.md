# QC Experiments

Welcome to the QC Experiments repository! This repo contains various quantum computing experiments. Our goal is to explore and benchmark quantum algorithms and compare their performance with classical counterparts.

## Current Projects

### 1. Feature Selection (Ongoing)
We are currently working on a **feature selection experiment** using Dirac3, where we aim to:
- Implement a classical feature selection algorithm.
- Translate the dataset into quantum circuit representations.
- Compare the performance of classical algorithms vs quantum algorithms using:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **F1 score**
  - **Processing time**

For more details, see the [Feature Selection folder](feature_selection/README.md).
